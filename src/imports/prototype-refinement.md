Context Update — Prototype Refinement (Do Not Restart)

Continue working from the existing prototype and screens.
Do not reset or re-scaffold the project.
This is a refinement of framing and interaction model, not a rebuild.

Important framing correction:
This product is not a chatbot shopping experience.
It is an AI-guided ecommerce flow where brief conversational input is used only for intent capture and explanation, after which the experience transitions into a structured ecommerce layout.

What to change (high priority):

De-emphasize persistent chat UI

Chat bubbles should not be the primary browsing interface

Conversation should appear as short prompts, onboarding questions, or helper copy

Reframe the AI role

AI acts as invisible guidance, not a constant speaker

After intent is captured, product discovery and bundling should be shown using standard ecommerce patterns (cards, grids, summaries)

Promote the bundle experience as the hero

The bundle recommendation screen should feel like a core ecommerce page

AI explanations should be secondary (inline notes, tooltips, small helper text)

What to keep (do not remove):

The idea of conversational intent capture at the beginning

AI-generated rationales for product selection

Add-to-cart inside the guided flow

Checkout handoff as a simulated final step

Specific refinements to apply:

Convert chat-style intent capture into:

A guided onboarding step

Or a short “answer a few questions” flow

Convert chat-based recommendations into:

A bundle grid or stacked product cards

With clear pricing, ratings, and swap/remove controls

Reduce AI copy volume; prioritize clarity over personality

Design intent:

This prototype should evaluate ecommerce decision-making, not conversational novelty

The experience should feel like “shopping, but smarter,” not “chatting with a bot”

Apply these refinements across existing screens and components.
Preserve what works; adjust layout, hierarchy, and interaction patterns to match this framing.
