Context: Intelligent Refinement (Do Not Restart)

Continue working from the existing prototype and screens.
Do not reset, redesign from scratch, or remove existing functionality unless explicitly instructed.
This update enhances decision intelligence, taste, and confidence, not core flow.

Product Framing (Locked)

This is not a chatbot shopping experience.
It is an AI-guided ecommerce flow where:

Short conversational input is used only for intent capture

The primary experience is a structured ecommerce interface

AI expresses intelligence through bundling, prioritization, and taste

Use Placeholders Everywhere

Product images: neutral placeholders or apparel silhouettes

Videos: static thumbnail labeled “Video preview (placeholder)”

Products: mock names, mock prices, mock ratings

Locations, weather, intelligence: simulated logic only

Speed, clarity, and believability matter more than realism.

1️⃣ Enhance Onboarding — Intent Template (Keep Existing, Improve Intelligence)

Keep the existing intent onboarding, but enhance it with structured fill-in-the-blank guidance.

UI pattern: single guided sentence builder:

I want to [ activity ]
in [ location ]
around [ time / month ]
and I consider myself [ skill level ]

Example helper text:

“I want to go skiing in Whistler around January and I consider myself a beginner.”

Inputs should remain lightweight and non-chatty.

Include Gender (Neutral & Respectful)

Add a selector:

Shopping for

Women

Men

Unisex

Prefer not to say

This affects product selection and fit only — not tone or messaging.

2️⃣ Add a Style / Vibe Axis (High-Value Control)

Add a single style axis control near the top of the bundle experience.

Label:

Overall Vibe
← Performance-first     Balanced     Refined →

This is not a filter.
The AI interprets it to:

Adjust silhouettes

Adjust materials

Adjust perceived quality

Maintain safety and warmth priorities

Add subtle helper copy:

“This influences overall look and material choices.”

3️⃣ Add a “Why This Works” Summary (Critical)

Add a short AI-generated summary card above or beside the bundle:

Why this outfit works

“Built for cold alpine conditions in Whistler, this setup prioritizes warmth and comfort for a beginner skier — with a jacket you can continue using beyond this trip.”

This summary should:

Be concise (2–3 lines)

Explain tradeoffs, not just features

Reinforce confidence

4️⃣ Enhance the Bundle Page (Primary Experience)

Keep the existing bundle layout, but ensure:

Product cards show:

Placeholder image

Name

Price

Rating

One-line rationale

The bundle feels like a core ecommerce page, not an AI output

Add subtle contextual cues:

Location tag (e.g., “Whistler • January conditions”)

Weather icon (e.g., cold / snow)

5️⃣ Budget Slider — Smarter Behavior

Keep the existing budget slider, but reinforce intelligent prioritization:

Moving right upgrades key items first (e.g., jacket)

Moving left downgrades accessories first

Core warmth/safety items are protected

Add occasional AI feedback:

“We invested more in the jacket since it’s versatile across skill levels.”

6️⃣ Product Detail Page (PDP) — Enriched but Calm

Keep or enhance the PDP with:

Larger placeholder image

Product name, price, rating

Size selector

Short AI explanation

Placeholder video tile:

“Product video preview (coming soon)”

Primary CTA: Replace in bundle
Secondary: View similar options

7️⃣ Replace-in-Bundle Flow — Decision-Focused

When replacing an item:

Show 3–4 alternatives

Label each with a clear tradeoff:

Warmer

Lighter

More affordable

More premium

Keep the user in context — no full catalog browsing.

8️⃣ Confidence & Assurance (Small but Powerful)

Near the “Add full bundle to cart” CTA, add one reassurance line:

Examples:

“Everything in this bundle works together.”

“No critical items missing.”

“Optimized for your trip and experience level.”

This is an emotional closure moment.

Design & Tone Guidance

AI should feel opinionated but calm

Avoid excessive explanations

Prioritize taste, confidence, and clarity

This should feel like shopping with an expert merchandiser

Deliverable

Expand the existing prototype to include:

Vibe / style intelligence

Decision summaries

Confidence signals

Smarter bundle behavior

PDP + replace flows

Use placeholders for all assets.
Preserve the current structure while enhancing intelligence and trust.
